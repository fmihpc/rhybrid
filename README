RHYBRID

RHybrid (paRallel Hybrid) is a parallel C++/MPI kinetic plasma
simulation model platform for the solar wind and plasma interactions
of celestial bodies. The RHybrid code is originally developed at the
Finnish Meteorological Institute. The RHybrid code is distributed
under the GPL v3 open source license by the Finnish Meteorological
Institute.

SIMULATION CODE

RHybrid is based on the following open source libraries for space
plasma simulations developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute:

Corsair - Parallel Simulation Platform
https://github.com/fmihpc/corsair

ParGrid - Parallel Grid
https://github.com/fmihpc/pargrid

VLSV - Parallel File Format
https://github.com/fmihpc/vlsv

Zoltan library (https://sandialabs.github.io/Zoltan/) is used for
partitioning and balacing computational load between MPI processing
elements.

COMPILATION

See INSTALL for an example how to compile.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, CO-AUTHORSHIP AND CITING

The RHybrid developers strongly encourage offering us co-authorship as
well as acknowledging and citing the original model when publishing or
presenting results where RHybrid code was used. We are open for
scientific collaborations and further development of the model and are
committed to open science.

Example acknowledgement text:

"Simulations were performed using the RHybrid code distributed under
the open source GPL v3 license by the Finnish Meteorological Institute
(github.com/fmihpc/rhybrid)."
